So, I recently decided that I'd like to learn C++. Maybe not become an expert C++ developer, which I assume takes many years, but be comfortable enough
in the language to have it be useful. I think "proficient in C++" would be the right way to put it. The purpose of this blog will be for me to track my thoughts
and learning, and I also thought there might be someone else out there like me trying to learn and maybe they want to follow along...or sympathize with me.

I should say up front that I am not learning C++ as a _new_ developer. I am (what I would consider) a relatively experienced Python and JavaScript (Node.js) developer. 
In fact, I currently write code for a living. C++ always seemed like some monstrous beast of a language that was too difficult or not worth the tremendous effort to learn. I think I've
come to a point in my _programming development_ where learning C++ would help me improve as a developer, so why not give it a shot. 

You'll probably see me make reference to idioms and patterns in python _a lot_. Python is currently my favorite language, but it is obviously _very_ different than C++ in many ways. You will
probably also see me make egregious errors in C++, things that would make a seasoned C++ developer cry out in pain. I think this is part of the learning process, and it's important to make mistakes while
learning new things, especially programming languages. With that being said, anything I write should NOT be used as a reference or tutorial of any sort. I mostly have no idea what I'm doing.
