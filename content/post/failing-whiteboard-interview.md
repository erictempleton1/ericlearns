Whiteboard interviews are tough. Although I work as a developer, I've never had a whiteboard interview until recently. I went on an interview for a Software Developer role at a company I was interested in, and the interview went pretty terrible...particularly the whiteboard portion. It's the same old story that's been told a thousand times before- I was super nervous, the questions were basically puzzles unrelated to the job, and the interviewers (although experienced developers) were probably not experienced interviewers. All of this together resulted in:

> Thanks for your interest, but we need someone with more experience.

This decision is of course based on the fact that I could only come up with brute force solutions to their puzzles and couldn't name the asymptotic (Big O) runtimes, and not my ability to produce production ready code or my day to day development experience. Fair enough I guess. If they looked at actual code I've written and said 

> Wow, this code is shit!

then maybe I'd be more broken up about the whole thing, but that didn't happen. Instead I got puzzles and frustrated interviewers. I did  actually study and practice prior to this interview, but I've come to the conclusion that trying to _learn_ new things in preperation for an interview is probably a bad idea and maybe even a red flag. Cramming isn't going to make up for lack of experience. I am not saying that you shouldn't prepare for an interview (far from it), but I think a good fit is going to come naturally with the experience and knowledge you already have.

So what happens for me next? _Learn more and keep going_.

This interview was definitely a failure and a blow to me, but it was also an awesome learning opportunity. I do not have a CS degree, so there are definitely some areas I am really lacking in and I need to address. I also got some great experience being up at the whiteboard and trying to work through a problem while someone (usually a more senior developer) watches on. It's hard (impossible?) to replicate this scenario without actually being in an interview. At the end of the day I am going to get a lot from this interview failure because it's going to push me even more to learn and grow. Maybe I should send someone a thank you for that? Eh, maybe not.

So there are some things I am going to work on. Specifically, algorithms and data structures as well as studying up runtimes and optimizations. I'll be doing a series of posts on what I'm learning, while writing solutions in `Python` and `C++` the best I can.

If you're reading this and you've recently had a technical interview that went poorly I'd encourage you to _really_ evaluate where the interview went wrong and what areas you can improve on. Although there was no job offer, and that hurts I know, you got a _huge_ amount of experience going through the process even if it doesn't feel like it right now. Your efforts weren't all for nothing.
