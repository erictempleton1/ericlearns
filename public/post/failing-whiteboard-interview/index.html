      <p>Whiteboard interviews are tough. Although I work as a developer, I&rsquo;ve never had a whiteboard interview until recently. I went on an interview for a Software Developer role at a company I was interested in, and the interview went pretty terrible&hellip;particularly the whiteboard portion. It&rsquo;s the same old story that&rsquo;s been told a thousand times before- I was super nervous, the questions were basically puzzles unrelated to the job, and the interviewers (although experienced developers) were probably not experienced interviewers. All of this together resulted in:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for your interest, but we need someone with more experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This decision is of course based on the fact that I could only come up with brute force solutions to their puzzles and couldn&rsquo;t name the asymptotic (Big O) runtimes, and not my ability to produce production ready code or my day to day development experience. Fair enough I guess. If they looked at actual code I&rsquo;ve written and said</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wow, this code is shit!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>then maybe I&rsquo;d be more broken up about the whole thing, but that didn&rsquo;t happen. Instead I got puzzles and frustrated interviewers. I did  actually study and practice prior to this interview, but I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that trying to <em>learn</em> new things in preperation for an interview is probably a bad idea and maybe even a red flag. Cramming isn&rsquo;t going to make up for lack of experience. I am not saying that you shouldn&rsquo;t prepare for an interview (far from it), but I think a good fit is going to come naturally with the experience and knowledge you already have.</p>

<p>So what happens for me next? <em>Learn more and keep going</em>.</p>

<p>This interview was definitely a failure and a blow to me, but it was also an awesome learning opportunity. I do not have a CS degree, so there are definitely some areas I am really lacking in and I need to address. I also got some great experience being up at the whiteboard and trying to work through a problem while someone (usually a more senior developer) watches on. It&rsquo;s hard (impossible?) to replicate this scenario without actually being in an interview. At the end of the day I am going to get a lot from this interview failure because it&rsquo;s going to push me even more to learn and grow. Maybe I should send someone a thank you for that? Eh, maybe not.</p>

<p>So there are some things I am going to work on. Specifically, algorithms and data structures as well as studying up runtimes and optimizations. I&rsquo;ll be doing a series of posts on what I&rsquo;m learning, while writing solutions in <code>Python</code> and <code>C++</code> the best I can.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re reading this and you&rsquo;ve recently had a technical interview that went poorly I&rsquo;d encourage you to <em>really</em> evaluate where the interview went wrong and what areas you can improve on. Although there was no job offer, and that hurts I know, you got a <em>huge</em> amount of experience going through the process even if it doesn&rsquo;t feel like it right now. Your efforts weren&rsquo;t all for nothing.</p>
